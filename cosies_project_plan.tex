\section{Vision Statement}
\begin{center}
OnLine Concepts bespoke product will increase the productivity of Cozies Insulations call centre, integrating the sales and marketing record-keeping systems into a "Sales Management"
software package, pinpointing attainable clients for the sales reps to maximize sales acquisition.
\end{center}

\section{Business Driver}
\begin{flushleft}
Cosie's Insulation suffers from data-mismanagement that is manifesting in inefficient communication between call-centre staff and the sales team. Call centre staff are paid on commission of booked sales appointments, this poor communication is costing Cosie's in un-earned commissions paid to call centre staff. This has also contributed to high staff turnover, as sales staff are increasingly frustrated by attending erroneous or non-existent sales appointments. Replacing staff incurs training and financial burdens. In addition, there is the potential for governance issues regarding Australian law on "do-not-call" lists, the repercussions for breaching these laws can run costs significantly high. OnLine's solution will better integrate the residential data for more effective communication between teams, with a by-product of efficient supervision of call centre staff operations.

If this integrated solution is not adopted, Cosies Insulation's call centre will continue to book erroneous appointments for sales staff and Sales staff will continue to turnover at a rate that the company cannot effectively sustain. In addition, the possibility of residential data requiring to be "washed" in accordance with Australian Law is expensive. If no action is taken Cosies can expect data, monetary, and personnel wastage.
