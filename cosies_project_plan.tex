\section{Vision Statement}
\begin{center}
OnLine Concepts bespoke product will increase the productivity of Cozies Insulations call centre, integrating the sales and marketing record-keeping systems into a "Sales Management"
software package, pinpointing attainable clients for the sales reps to maximize sales acquisition.
\end{center}
\section{Business Driver}
\begin{flushleft}
A data-mismanagement problem in the call centre has been identified.  This problem is causing inefficiencies between call centre staff and sales teams.  These problems have wide-ranging effects, including high staff turnover as sales stare are attending erroneous or non-existent sales meetings.  High staff turnover incurs replacement staff training and financial burdens.  There is also the potential for expensive governance issues regarding Australian law and "do-not-call" lists.  OnLine's solution will allow for better integration of residential data with a by-product of efficient governance of call centre staff.
\par
If this integrated solution is not adopted, Cosies Insulation's call centre will continue to book erroneous appointments for sales staff and sales staff will continue to turnover at a rate that the company cannot effectively sustain. The possibility of residential data requiring to be "washed" in accordance with Australian law is expensive.  If no action is taken Cosies can expect data, monetary, and personnel wastage.
