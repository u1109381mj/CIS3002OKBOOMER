\section{Vision Statement}
\begin{center}
OnLine Concepts bespoke product will increase the productivity of Cozies Insulations' call centre, integrating the sales and marketing record-keeping systems into a "Sales Management"
software package, pinpointing attainable clients for the sales reps to maximize sales acquisition.
\end{center}

\section{Business Driver}
\begin{flushleft}
Cosie's Insulation suffers from data-mismanagement that is manifesting in inefficiencies between call-centre staff and the sales team. In addition, there is wastage of the time-limited residential data being purchased. Also, call centre staff are paid on commission of booked sales appointments, appointments made without proper vetting by the phone script is costing Cosies Insulation in incorrect commissions paid to call centre staff. This has contributed to high staff turnover, as sales staff are increasingly frustrated by attending erroneous or non-existent sales appointments. Replacing staff incurs training and financial burdens. Finally, as each call centre staff member maintains its own information on potential sales leads and also non-leads, there is wastage of resources in the collation of this data for delivery to the sales team.

If this integrated solution is not adopted, Cosies Insulation's call centre will continue to book erroneous appointments for sales staff and Sales staff will continue to turnover at a rate that the company cannot effectively sustain. Cosies Insulation will also continue to make inefficient use of expensive "washed" residential data. If no action is taken Cosies can expect continued data, monetary, and personnel wastage.
